# Shiny
A simple app to calculate mercury vapor pressure at different temperatures

Initially attempted to run more complicated models and use external datasets, but some limitations in what Shiny can do (and of course lack of experience in shiny development) resulted in final application being much simpler than what I would have liked to do. Investing more time on shiny can certainly help.
