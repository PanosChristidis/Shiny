Mercury vapor pressure at different temperatures

Overview
========================================================

This is a simple appliction on shiny, just to explore what can be done.

- Work started with a lot of ambition (the goal was to show a complex using an external dataset that combined quantitative and qualitative variables and -if possible- show results on a map).

- Many things didnÂ´t work as expected (using external data, combining different types of input), which is normal for the time allocated. But at least the basics have been assiniliated!

- So, what we have here is a demonstration using a small dataset that comes with R (pressure) that shows how we can run a simple prediction model using shiny


The dataset
========================================================

```{r}
summary(pressure)
```

Correlation pressure-temperature
========================================================

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

The model
========================================================

- Yes, it is really simple (and probably wrong)

```{r}
library(caret)
model<-train(pressure ~ temperature-1, method="glm", data=pressure)

summary(model)

```

- Now have a look at the online version, which allows you to estimate pressure at different temperatures, based on this model:
