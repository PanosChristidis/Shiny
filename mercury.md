Overview
========================================================

This is a simple appliction on shiny, just to explore what can be done.

- Work started with a lot of ambition (the goal was to show a complex using an external dataset that combined quantitative and qualitative variables and -if possible- show results on a map).

- Many things didnÂ´t work as expected (using external data, combining different types of input), which is normal for the time allocated. But at least the basics have been assiniliated!

- So, what we have here is a demonstration using a small dataset that comes with R (pressure) that shows how we can run a simple prediction model using shiny


The dataset
========================================================


```r
summary(pressure)
```

```
  temperature     pressure       
 Min.   :  0   Min.   :  0.0002  
 1st Qu.: 90   1st Qu.:  0.1800  
 Median :180   Median :  8.8000  
 Mean   :180   Mean   :124.3367  
 3rd Qu.:270   3rd Qu.:126.5000  
 Max.   :360   Max.   :806.0000  
```

Correlation pressure-temperature

The model
========================================================

- Yes, it is really simple (and probably wrong)


```r
library(caret)
model<-train(pressure ~ temperature-1, method="glm", data=pressure)

summary(model)
```

```

Call:
NULL

Deviance Residuals:

-158.08  -117.06   -32.84    72.30   409.43

    Null deviance: 908195  on 18  degrees of freedom
Residual deviance: 386665  on 17  degrees of freedom

- Now have a look at the online version, which allows you to estimate pressure at different temperatures, based on this model:
